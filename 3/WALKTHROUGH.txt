Move from room to room in order to find and interact with Christina, Robert, and Veronica.

## Christina: <Take quiz>

Answer key: 0, 1, 3, 2, 2

## Robert: <Ask about flowers>

The task may only be done if Robert is the only person in the room. If Veronica
is in the room, you may get rid of her by beating her at Blackjack, but no other
character may be moved. If this happens, you will need to wait until the next
game loop. Either close and re-run the class file, or force the day to restart
by moving to Lucia's room and inspecting the closet.

Repeat this task until she loves him (at which point you will gain Robert's trust).

## Veronica: <Play rock-paper-scissors>

Play until you lose (you gain Veronica's trust once you lose).

Alternatively, <Play Blackjack> and win.

Now that you have gained the trust of these three characters, move to the living
room and <Play the piano>. After playing the piano, <Inspect piano>.

The game has been completed.
