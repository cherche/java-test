# One More Time
A Doctor Who text-based fan game.

## To-do
- [ ] Implement rolling dialogue like in Pok√©mon (including the requirement of ENTER to print the next dialogue)
- [ ] Actually include the entire story instead of the general code for a game of this type
- [ ] Rewrite the `Game.runRoom()` method to be more efficient code-wise
