# One More Time
A Doctor Who text-based fan game.

## To-do
- [ ] Add a way to tell whether something was actually done when the room was run or not
- [ ] Create a nice way to move people from one room to another
- [x] Add a nice class to manage text output
- [ ] Actually include the entire story instead of the general code for a game of this type
- [ ] Rewrite the `Game.runRoom()` method to be more efficient code-wise
